# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict whether a breast cancer patient will survive after surgery by analyzing various clinical and biological features. It uses machine learning techniques, specifically the Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to classify patients into "Alive" or "Dead" categories based on their medical data.
